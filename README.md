# NIA CARD Long read sequencing group bioinformatics tutorial
Summarizing the foundational data management, processing, and analysis steps we do in the NIA CARD LRS group.
# Data management
## Data transfer from the PromethIONs
## Raw data sequencing QC
We use a set of two Python scripts to collect critical quality control parameters for weekly and cohort-wide sequencing runs, such as read N50, per flow cell output, experiment output, and flow cell starting active pores.
# Data processing
## Basecalling
## Mapping to a human genome reference
## Checking for sample swaps (case specific)
# Variant calling
## Single nucleotide variants (SNVs)
## Short tandem repeats (STRs)
## Structural variants (SVs)
## Merging variant calls
## Annotating variant calls
